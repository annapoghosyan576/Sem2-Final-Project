# Challenges/Solutions
I faced a few challenges while building this website, but I was able to overcome or work around most of them. 

  **1. Challenge:** Storing the Vocab Words/Definitions; **Solution:** I used localstorage to store key/value pairs to the browser. 
  
  **2. Challenge:** Hiding the content on the back of the flashcard when only one side is showing; **Solution:** setting backface-visiblity to hidden
  
  **3. Challenge:** Some links in the resource page were blocked from opening in Replit; **Solution:** I worked around this by testing the links and choosing to include resources that did not have this problem
